                <p class="product-desc">Even an invincible ninja may not be able to survive Hell's Paradise!
                    Gabimaru is a ninja on death row with one chance to see his wife again—by finding the elixir of
                    immortality on a supernatural island and delivering it to the shogun. Standing in his way are his
                    fellow convicts and the fearsome beasts that roam the island, devouring or killing anyone they
                    encounter.

                    Gabimaru and his companions are confronted with the mysteries of tao, the supernatural phenomenon
                    that turns the beings known as Lord Tensen into fearsome enemies. And when Gabimaru begins acting
                    strangely, is there any hope for his companions, or will they face certain death at his hands?</p>

                <p class="product-desc">
                    A high school romantic comedy with five times the cute girls! A high school boy must work part-time
                    to help five sisters study so they can graduate, but the only thing these quintuplets have in common
                    is that they all hate studying!

                    FIVE TIMES THE TROUBLE

                    Five girls who want to do anything but study, and their tutor: A high school boy who's got book
                    smarts and not much else. Futaro Uesugi took the tutoring gig because he was desperate for cash, but
                    when his students--the five beautiful daughters of a wealthy businessman--find five times the
                    excuses to slack off, what can he do?! At this rate, the sisters won't graduate, so if he wants to
                    get paid, Futaro must think of a plan to suit each of them... Which feels hopeless when five out of
                    five of them think he's a loser!
